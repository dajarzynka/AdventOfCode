# AdventOfCode
This is my repo for solving AdventOfCode problems.

Nothing fancy just solving the problems using C# and a basic console app.

These kinds of problems remind me much more of my college homework assignments than the kind of work that I do on a day to day basis. They're a nice change of pace.

In general, these solutions are written with the mindset of "Does it run in a reasonable amount of time?" and "If someone else were to look at this code, could they figure it out very quickly?"
